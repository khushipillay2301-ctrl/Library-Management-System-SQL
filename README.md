📚 Library Management System – SQL Project

📌 Project Overview

This project is a Library Management System built using SQL, designed to manage and organize library data efficiently. It helps in maintaining information related to books, authors, publishers, library branches, and book lending records.

The main goal of this project is to understand database design, relationships, and querying data effectively using SQL.

🎯 Objectives

To design a structured relational database for a library system


To manage books, publishers, and library branches


To maintain proper relationships using primary and foreign keys


To perform CRUD operations and meaningful SQL queries


🛠️ Technologies Used

Database: MySQL

Language: SQL

Tools: MySQL Workbench / Command Line


🗂️ Database Structure

The project includes multiple tables such as:

books – stores book details

publisher – stores publisher information

library_branch – stores branch details

book_copies – tracks number of copies per branch

book_loans – manages book issue and return records

All tables are connected using primary keys and foreign keys to maintain data integrity.


🔑 Key Concepts Implemented

Database normalization

Primary Key and Foreign Key constraints

One-to-many relationships

SQL joins

Subqueries

Aggregate functions


📊 Sample Queries


Retrieve all books available in a specific branch

Find books issued by a particular borrower

Check number of copies available per branch

List publishers and their published books

🚀 How to Run the Project


Open MySQL Workbench or MySQL CLI

Create a new database

Run the SQL script file

Execute queries to view and manage library data
